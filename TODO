TODO
- clustering
- dynamically adjusted precision for all calculations
- fix all memory leaks
- implement real color palette handling, get rid of global variable mandelcolors
- improve statistics about calculated/saved iterations, must become
  thread-safe too
- fix asm routine to support Julia set
- build a generic rendering framework to support arbitrary different fractal
  types
- support Julia set in GUI
- find a way to parallelize the boundary trace method
- don't pass so many parameters to mandel_julia() and friends, some of them are
  in mandeldata
- Use mandeldata struct for loading and saving files, instead of GtkMandelArea
- looks like the event sources for updating the screen don't get removed properly
  This problem still occurs, but rarely. For some reason, g_source_remove()
  seems to fail occasionally.
- implement my_mpn_invert() in IA32 assembler (using SSE2?)
