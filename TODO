TODO
- clustering
- dynamically adjusted precision for all calculations
- fix all memory leaks
- include maxiter, power of Z (and maybe color settings) in history and coord files
- implement real color palette handling, get rid of global variable mandelcolors
- improve statistics about calculated/saved iterations, must become
  thread-safe too
- fix asm routine to support Julia set
- build a generic rendering framework to support arbitrary different fractal
  types
- support Julia set in GUI
- find a way to parallelize the boundary trace method
- better means of setting GtkMandel's parameters, gtk_mandel_restart_thread()
  is starting to have way too may parameters
- don't pass so many parameters to mandel_julia() and friends, some of them are
  in mandeldata
- Split mandeldata into a generic description of fractal and a rendering state.
  Use the generic description to replace GtkMandelArea (except for the
  "selection" signal).
