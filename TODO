TODO
- clustering
- dynamically adjusted precision for all calculations
- fix all memory leaks
- implement real color palette handling, get rid of global variable mandelcolors
- improve statistics about calculated/saved iterations, must become
  thread-safe too
- fix asm routine to support Julia set
- find a way to parallelize the boundary trace method
- implement my_mpn_invert() in IA32 assembler (using SSE2?)
- fix coord/*.coord, they are still in the old file format
- put image and controls in separate windows
- orbit window
- take precision of parameter into account when computing required precision
  to render Julia set
- why is the precision sometimes insufficient when rendering Julia set?!
- verify that commit 2d6d396232bdbbc12984ec00e85ede4504aebfc4 didn't have any
  bad performance implications
- use the asm routine again
