TODO
- clustering
- dynamically adjusted precision for all calculations
- dynamic widget size && non-1:1 aspect ratio
- fix all memory leaks
- include maxiter (and maybe color settings) in history and coord files
- do all GDK/GTK calls in the main thread (this will make the program work
  on Win32, where GDK calls from multiple threads are not allowed)
- implement real color palette handling, get rid of global variable mandelcolors
