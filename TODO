TODO
- clustering
- dynamically adjusted precision for all calculations
- fix all memory leaks
- include maxiter (and maybe color settings) in history and coord files
- implement real color palette handling, get rid of global variable mandelcolors
- z^n + c, with n > 2
- improve statistics about calculated/saved iterations, must become
  thread-safe too
- fix asm routine to support Julia set
- build a generic rendering framework to support arbitrary different fractal
  types
- support Julia set in GUI
- find a way to parallelize the boundary trace method
