TODO
- clustering
- dynamically adjusted precision for all calculations
- fix all memory leaks
- include maxiter (and maybe color settings) in history and coord files
- implement real color palette handling, get rid of global variable mandelcolors
- z^n + c, with n > 2
- improve statistics about calculated/saved iterations, must become
  thread-safe too
- fix race condition when window is resized, we sometimes attempt to render
  an out-of-range area of the pixbuf
