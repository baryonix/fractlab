TODO
- clustering
- dynamically adjusted precision for all calculations
- fix all memory leaks
- include maxiter (and maybe color settings) in history and coord files
- do all GDK/GTK calls in the main thread (this will make the program work
  on Win32, where GDK calls from multiple threads are not allowed)
  This was attempted (mandel-gtk-render-g_idle_add.patch), but failed because
  the resulting performance was very bad. Seems that we're lucky gdk_flush()
  isn't automatically called when rendering from other threads.
  We'll have to find a more efficient way of displaying the image on the screen
  than rendering the pixels one-by-one.
- implement real color palette handling, get rid of global variable mandelcolors
- z^n + c, with n > 2
- improve statistics about calculated/saved iterations, must become
  thread-safe too
