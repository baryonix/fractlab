	<h1><code>mandel-gtk</code></h1>

	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p><code>mandel-gtk</code> is a toolkit for rendering fractal graphics.
	Currently, the only fractal type supported is the Mandelbrot set, but
	(just as potentially anything else) this is subject to change in the
	future. Julia sets are now implemented in the rendering backend, but
	the GUI doesn't support them yet.</p>

	<p>The package consists of <code>mandel-gtk</code> itself, a graphical
	frontend for interactive zooming based on GTK&nbsp;2.0, as well as
	<code>mandel-zoom</code>, a command-line utility which can be used to
	render those fancy zooming animations I like so much.</p>

	<h2>Arbitrary-Precision Math</h2>

	<p><code>mandel-gtk</code> relies on the
	<a href="http://www.swox.com/gmp/">GNU GMP</a> library (and partly
	on <a href="http://www.mpfr.org/">MPFR</a>, an extension to GMP) to do
	its calculations with arbitrarily
	high precision. So, you can zoom in as far as you want and will never
	hit any limits, except for those of your machine's CPU power. I have
	rendered images at magnifications of around 10<sup>90</sup>, and
	the performance is still workable on a single-CPU Pentium&nbsp;4 machine
	running at 1.6&nbsp;GHz.</p>

	<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As of this writing, this is not entirely true.
	In some non-critical places, the program currently still uses
	fixed-precision variables. However, those variables have a very high
	precision by default (1024&nbsp;bits); if you need more, you can easily
	increase their precision by changing the parameter of the
	<code>mpf_set_default_prec()</code> and
	<code>mpfr_set_default_prec()</code> calls in the source code. Increasing
	the precision of these variables will have virtually no impact on the
	rendering performance, but 1024&nbsp;bits have always been enough for
	me.</p>

	<h2>Optimizations</h2>

	<p>The three main targets in the development of <code>mandel-gtk</code> are
	performance, performance, and performance. Different optimization
	techniques make the rendering process much faster than the "basecase"
	of rendering each pixel in turn would be.</p>

	<p>The gory details of these optimizations are described in great detail
	at <a href="http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency.html">Mu-Ency</a>, which is
	also where I learned them from. Thanks, Rob!</p>

	<p>Of course, <code>mandel-gtk</code> and </code>mandel-zoom</code> are
	both built on the same backend algorithms, so these performance
	considerations apply similarly to both of them.</p>

	<h3>Dynamically Scaled Precision</h3>

	<p><code>mandel-gtk</code> dynamically adjusts the precision of its
	computations to provide as much precision as required, but not (much) more.
	Floating-point hardware will be used as long as its precision is
	sufficient. On the IA32 architecture, a hand-optimized assembly routine
	will be used for this purpose. This assembly routine currently doesn't
	support Julia sets (so the C implementation is used instead to render
	them).</p>
	
	<p>As the required precision grows, <code>mandel-gtk</code> will reside
	to software-supported multi-precision arithmetics, performing only
	fixed-point integer computations. The critical loops interface with GMP
	at the lowest level possible (known as the <code>mpn</code> layer of
	GMP) to gain the highest possible performance.</p>

	<h3>Cycle Detection</h3>

	<p><code>mandel-gtk</code> will detect when its iteration for some point
	gets caught in a loop, calculating the same values over and over again,
	and proceed to the next point immediately, assuming that the current
	point is in fact an element of the Mandelbrot set.</p>

	<h3>Parallel Computation</h3>

	<p>Both the Successive Refinement and the Mariani-Silver algorithms
	(see Area Detection, below) can render a single image in parallel using
	multiple threads, so you will be able to make efficient use of multi-core
	CPUs or multi-CPU machines (or multi-multicore-CPU machines:-) in the
	<code>mandel-gtk</code> GUI.</p>

	<p><code>mandel-zoom</code> uses a different approach here: Each frame
	of the animation is computed in a single thread, and multiple threads
	work on different frames at the same time. This minimizes the
	interdependencies between the threads' computation results (possibly
	making more efficient use of the CPU caches) and the required amount of
	inter-thread communications. In fact, the only place where
	<code>mandel-zoom</code> has a need for thread synchronization is when
	it determines which frame should be rendered next.</p>

	<p>I'm also planning to implement clustering functionality, so you will
	be able to render in parallel using the CPUs of multiple machines connected
	via a network. Most probably, this feature will first become available only
	in <code>mandel-zoom</code>.</p>

	<h3>Area Detection</h3>

	<p><code>mandel-gtk</code> can detect solid areas in the image it
	generates, and will skip over most part of the interior of those areas.
	Three different algorithms are implemented to achieve this.</p>

	<h4>Successive Refinement</h4>

	<p>This algorithm works by first computing a coarse view of the whole
	image, then refining the image in multiple passes and skipping over areas
	which are expected to show up in a solid color. Successive Refinement
	parallelizes well and is
	best suited for interactive zooming, as you don't usually have to wait
	for the computation to finish at full resolution before selecting an area
	to zoom into.</p>

	<p>Note however that, although not too bad, the accuracy of the images
	generated using successive refinement is not as good as that of the
	other two methods.</p>

	<h4>Mariani-Silver</h4>

	<p>This is more of a divide-and-conquer approach, which works by dividing
	the image into smaller and smaller rectangular areas and further dividing
	each sub-area only if more detail is expected to show up inside.
	Mariani-Silver also parallelizes well and is useful for rendering
	a single image with high accuracy.</p>

	<h4>Boundary Tracing</h4>

	<p>This method works by "walking along" the boundaries of solid regions
	and flood filling the interior after the complete boundary of a region
	has been rendered. Boundary tracing is slightly faster than Mariani-Silver,
	but is hard (if not impossible) to parallelize -- the current
	implementation runs in a single thread only. This is the weapon of choice
	for the rendering of animations (where parallelization takes place at the
	frame level), and of single images if you're using a single processor.</p>

	<h2>Portability</h2>

	<p><code>mandel-gtk</code> theoretically supports any architecture where
	Glib (with threading support) and GTK are available. It has been tested
	on 32-bit and 64-bit, both little and big endian architectures. It is
	unclear whether systems with a smaller word size work, but there is no
	inherent reason why they shouldn't. The <code>mandel-gtk</code> GUI has
	now been reworked to make all calls to GDK/GTK functions from within
	just a single thread, so it should theoretically be possible to build
	a native Win32 version too, but I haven't yet tried this.</p>

	<p><code>mandel-gtk</code> does not, and will never use the GNU
	<code>autoconf</code> framework.</p>

	<p>If you manage (or don't manage) to run <code>mandel-gtk</code> on a
	platform not mentioned below, I'll be glad to hear from you! I will then
	add your platform to the list, and happily include any patches
	you applied to make it work. I'm also willing to give assistance in
	porting <code>mandel-gtk</code> to new platforms.</p>

	<p><code>mandel-gtk</code> has been tested on the following systems:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><p>Linux on IA32</p></li>
		<li><p>FreeBSD on IA32</p></li>
		<li>
			<p>Linux on x86-64 (aka AMD64 or Intel&nbsp;EM64T)</p>
			<p>Tested on an HP ProLiant server system with two dual-core
			Xeon (Core&nbsp;Duo architecture) CPUs. This machine gives you
			the Mandelbrot power you need for the 21st century!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Solaris on UltraSPARC (compiled in 64-bit mode)</p>
			<p>For best performance, build GMP and <code>mandel-gtk</code>
			using the Sun C Compiler, which comes bundled with the
			freely-available (though closed-source)
			<a href="http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/index.jsp">Sun&nbsp;Studio</a>
			IDE. The recommended compiler flags for both GMP, MPFR
			and <code>mandel-gtk</code> are
			<code>-fast -fsimple=0 -fns=no</code>.
			Make sure you verify your compiler flags by running
			<code>make&nbsp;check</code> on GMP and MPFR!</p>
		</li>
		<li><p>NetBSD-current&nbsp;(4.99.3) on Alpha (EV56)</p></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Building <code>mandel-gtk</code></h2>

	<p>First, make sure you have the latest versions of
	<a href="http://www.swox.com/gmp/">GMP</a> and
	<a href="http://www.mpfr.org/">MPFR</a>. Any
	older version will probably work, but will also most probably not give
	the same level of performance. It is also adviseable to compile both of
	them on your own for the specific machine you intend to run
	<code>mandel-gtk</code> on. If you use precompiled binaries, GMP may not
	be able to use all the features your CPU provides, and may not deliver
	the performance it actually could if optimized properly.</p>

	<p>You will also need
	<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">libpng</a>; using
	a precompiled version is safe here.</p>

	<p>Download the source code, extract it and take a look at the
	<code>Makefile</code>. You will most probably have to change a few
	parameters in it to successfully build <code>mandel-gtk</code>. If you
	have a basic understanding of how <code>make</code> and your C compiler
	work, this will be an easy thing to do. If you don't, you'll probably have
	to wait until foolproof build instructions become available (which may
	never happen).</p>
